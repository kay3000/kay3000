 I'm into web stuff and currently hooked on learning JavaScript, React, and Next.js. Building things with Firebase, styling with Tailwind CSS, and storing data in MongoDB. Also, tinkering with Express and a dash of Django.

Current Tech Stack:

Let's code some cool projects and have fun doing it! ðŸš€
